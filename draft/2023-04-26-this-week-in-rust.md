## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [system-deps](https://crates.io/crates/system-deps), a crate that will compile your pkg-config-based dependencies for you.

Thanks to [Aleksey Kladov](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1191) for the suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A week mostly dominated by noise, in particular a persistent bimodality in
keccak and cranelift-codegen. No significant changes outside of that, a
relatively equal mix of regressions and improvements. Most of the bimodality
has been removed in the full report as it's just noise.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [74864fa..fdeef3e](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=74864fa496997a6498e623f0d2019ccb7eb6dad0&end=fdeef3ed1809aa9bd4ea9ff0fad92010c6de669c&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

3 Regressions, 6 Improvements, 5 Mixed; 1 of them in rollups
60 artifact comparisons made in total

[Full report here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2023-04-25.md)

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC: result_ffi_guarantees](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3391)

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* [Add RFC on governance, establishing the Leadership Council](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3392)

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* [disposition: merge] [Use fulfillment to check Drop impl compatibility](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/110577)
* [disposition: merge] [Only check outlives goals on impl compared to trait](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/109356)
* [disposition: merge] [rustdoc: restructure type search engine to pick-and-use IDs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/110371)
* [disposition: merge] [Stabilize raw-dylib, link_ordinal, import_name_type and -Cdlltool](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/109677)
* [disposition: merge] [Add deployment-target --print flag for Apple targets](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/105354)

### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)
* [new] [RFC: Rustdoc configuration via Cargo (includes feature descriptions)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3421)
* [new] [RFC: Partial Types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3420)

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

# Quote of the Week

> That said, I really like the language. It’s as if someone set out to design a programming language, and just picked all the right answers. Great ecosystem, flawless cross platform, built-in build tools, no “magic”, static binaries, performance-focused, built-in concurrency checks. Maybe these “correct” choices are just laser-targeted at my soul, but in my experience, once you leap over the initial hurdles, it all just works™️, without much fanfare.
